/*Butterfly needs to extend Insect. Butterfly needs two methods
A String to store the butterfly’s wing color
A String to store the butterfly’s favorite flower
Will these be public, private, or protected? 
		Add get and set methods for these variables.
Also, please add a constructor that takes 4 arguments – 
the butterfly’s name, wing color, number of wings, and favorite flower.
Also, add a method to the Butterfly class called printSpeciesData. 
This method should print all the info for a Butterfly object – 
it’s name, wing color, number of wings, number of legs, and favorite flower.*/
